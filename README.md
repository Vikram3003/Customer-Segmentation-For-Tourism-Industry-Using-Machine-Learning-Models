Manual customer segmentation is time-consuming. It takes months, even years to analyze piles of
data and find patterns manually. Also if done heuristically, it may not have the accuracy to be useful
as expected. Customer segmentation helps to understand what the users need. We can identify the
most active users or customers, and optimize the application towards the needs. The marketing
strategy can be directly improved with segmentation because the companies can plan personalized
marketing campaigns for different customer segments, using the channels that they use the most.
Customers have different needs. A one-size-for-all approach to business will generally result in less
engagement, lower-click through rates, and ultimately fewer sales. Customer segmentation is the cure
for this problem. Finding an optimal number of unique customer groups will help to understand how
the customers differ, and helps to give them exactly what they want. Customer segmentation improves
customer experience and boosts company revenue. That’s why segmentation is a must if the
companies want to surpass the competitors and get more customers. Doing it with machine learning
is definitely the right way to go. We’re targeting the tourism industry for customer segmentation.
